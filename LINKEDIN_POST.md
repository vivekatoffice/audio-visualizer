**Namaste Dosto! 👋**

Aaj main apna naya project share karne ke liye bahut excited hoon - ek **3D Audio Visualizer**! 🎵✨

Maine isse **Three.js**, **Web Audio API** aur **Electron** ka use karke banaya hai. Ye sirf ek music player nahi hai, balki music ko "dekhne" ka ek naya tareeka hai. 🎧👁️

**Is project ki kuch khaas baatein:**
🔹 **4 Unique Visualizations:** Pulsing Sphere, Wave Particles, Frequency Bars aur Expanding Rings.
🔹 **Real-time Analysis:** Music ke bass aur treble ke hisaab se visuals react karte hain.
🔹 **Premium Design:** Glassmorphism UI jo dekhne mein bahut modern lagta hai.
🔹 **Desktop App:** Electron ki madad se maine iska Windows executable (.exe) bhi banaya hai.

Code aur creativity ka ye sangam mujhe bahut pasand aaya. Aap video dekhein aur comments mein batayein ki aapko kaisa laga! 👇

### English Translation (for reference)

**Hello Friends! 👋**

Today I am very excited to share my new project - a **3D Audio Visualizer**! 🎵✨

I built this using **Three.js**, **Web Audio API**, and **Electron**. It's not just a music player, but a new way to "see" music. 🎧👁️

**Key features of this project:**
🔹 **4 Unique Visualizations:** Pulsing Sphere, Wave Particles, Frequency Bars, and Expanding Rings.
🔹 **Real-time Analysis:** Visuals react according to the bass and treble of the music.
🔹 **Premium Design:** Glassmorphism UI that looks very modern.
🔹 **Desktop App:** Using Electron, I also created a Windows executable (.exe) for it.

I really enjoyed this blend of code and creativity. Watch the video and let me know what you think in the comments! 👇
